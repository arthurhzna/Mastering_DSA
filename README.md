# Data Structures & Algorithms

A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implementations in Go, developed as part of my computer science fundamentals study.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and study notes covering essential data structures and algorithms concepts. Each module includes code examples, visual references, and practical applications.

## Contents

### Algorithms

- **Recursion** - Recursive problem-solving techniques
- **Sorting** - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort
- **Searching** - Binary Search, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Dynamic Programming** - Optimization through memoization and tabulation

### Data Structures

- **Arrays** - Linear data structure fundamentals
- **Hash Tables** - Key-value pair storage and retrieval
- **Linked Lists** - Singly and doubly linked implementations
- **Stacks & Queues** - LIFO and FIFO data structures
- **Trees** - Binary Trees, Priority Queues (Heaps)
- **Graphs** - Graph representation and traversal

## Implementation

All implementations are written in Go, focusing on:
- Clean, readable code
- Well-documented functions
- Practical examples
- Performance considerations

## Purpose

This repository serves as both a learning resource and reference material for fundamental computer science concepts. The implementations demonstrate core principles applicable across different programming languages and domains.

## Resources

Additional learning materials, diagrams, and reference documents are included in respective directories.
